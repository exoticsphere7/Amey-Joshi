## Welcome to my Home page

Hi, I am a 5th year student at IISER pune. Specializing in mathematics. I find geometry and topology fascinating and wish to dedicate my life to it. In my free time I like to play mouth organ, sketch, paint (mostly acrylic landscapes) and watch art house short films. I am interested in Indian history and Egyptian history.

# My previous Projects-
## 1. Study of Lie Groupoids-
 This was done under supervision of [Prof.S.K.Roushon](http://www.math.tifr.res.in/~roushon/cv.html) as a part of Tifr-VSRP 2020 program. We studied various papers of I. Moerdijk on Lie groupoids and orbifolds. The aim of this project was to study the category of Lie groupoids and see their connections to the classical algebraic topology and manifold theory. The project report can be found [here](https://github.com/exoticsphere7/Amey-Joshi/files/7047118/Lie_Groupoids.pdf)

 ## 2. Fibre Bundles and Milnor's Exotic sphere-
 This project was done under the supervision of [Prof. Mainak Poddar](https://sites.google.com/view/mainakpoddar) in the summer 2020. In the begining I studied the theory of characteristic classes from the books- [Vector Bundles and K-theory](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/VBKT/VBpage.html) and [Charcteristic classes](https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Characteristic_Classes/5zQ9AFk1i4EC?hl=en&gbpv=0). Then in the end I read the paper of Prof. John Milnor on the exotic smooth 7-sphere.


## 3. Symplectic Classes-
This project was done under the supervision of [Dr. Steven Spallone](https://sites.google.com/site/steventspallone/home). The project was primarily about the study of symplectic classes. We here took a slightly different approach, we assumed the existence and uniqueness of chern classes over complex bundles and proved the existence and uniqueness of symplectic classes for quaternionic bundles (though we sticked to the language of principal bundles). Then we used basic homotopy theory and double induction to find cohomology ring of the group Sp(n) and then used Serre's spectral seqeucen theory to find the cohomology of BSp(n). In the end, we wanted to estabilish analogue of various results relating chern and stiefel whitney classes to the quaternionic classes. We obsereved that such relations will exist if we have an analogue of Steenrod Squares to integral cohomology. But we proved with a counter example that it does not exist.
